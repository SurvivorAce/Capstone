# Disco D-Day

## What Disco D-Day intended to be.
  Disco D-Day is intended to be a silly 3D fighting game with ragdolls physics. 
  Inspired by [Gang Beasts](https://screenshots.en.sftcdn.net/en/scrn/69698000/69698849/image-03-700x394.jpg).

## Why Disco D-Day?
  Why not? For a completely serious answer, there isn’t a big reason for why we chose to do our project. We just happened to want to try 3D and a fighting game seemed most fun.

## What makes Disco D-Day unique?
  Well in our heads, the game was meant to be a fighting game that happened to erupt in the middle of your typical midday flashmob. Imagine fighting in the middle of a nightclub with people dancing all around you. Well not necessarily a nightclub but, the levels in mind were meant to be silly and not your typical place for people dancing.
 
## Resources? Process? Challenges?
  For our game we used Unity and a lot of videos. Challenge wise, it went pretty much as we expected. Unfamiliarity with Unity and 3D games in general plagued us, slowing us down more than expected.

## Well what can it do?
  As of now, there is/are player(s) and a level. The player can move around the map but there is no actual fighting. 
  As for what wasn’t feasible, just about most things weren’t. There were many small problems here and there and it took a lot of time doing the smallest of things. 
  As mentioned above, we didn’t have the time to finish the fighting aspect in an intended fighting game. Other than that, we had most of the bare bones down.
